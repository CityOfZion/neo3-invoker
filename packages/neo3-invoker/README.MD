  Neo3-Invoker - A declarative SmartContract Invocation Spec.
  <br/> Made with ‚ù§ by <b>COZ.IO</b>
</p>

# Neo3-Invoker
Neo3-Invoker is a specification of how SmartContract client SDKs can interact with different invoker libraries such Neon-JS or WalletConnect.

With Neo3-Invoker a SDK don't need to reimplement the wheel and can focus on the SmartContract communication format.
Taking advantage of the declarative nature of the specification, the SDK can be used with different invoker libraries, it only depends on what the dApp developer wants to use.

Visit the [main page](../../README.md) of the project.
